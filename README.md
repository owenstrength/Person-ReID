# Person Re-Identification using ResNet18 on Market-1501 Dataset

## Project Overview

This project implements a person re-identification (ReID) system using a modified ResNet18 architecture on the Market-1501 dataset. The goal is to accurately identify and match individuals across multiple non-overlapping camera views in a multi-camera surveillance system.

## Key Features

- **Model Architecture**: Modified ResNet18 backbone
- **Dataset**: Market-1501
- **Evaluation Metrics**: mean Average Precision (mAP), Cumulative Matching Characteristic (CMC)
- **Loss Function**: Cross-Entropy Loss with Label Smoothing

## Dataset

The Market-1501 dataset consists of 32,668 annotated bounding boxes of 1,501 identities. Images are captured from 6 different cameras, with 5 high-resolution cameras and 1 low-resolution camera. The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

## Methodology

### Model Architecture

We use a modified ResNet18 as our backbone network. The final fully connected layer is replaced with a new embedding layer followed by a classification layer. This allows the network to learn discriminative features for person re-identification while maintaining a relatively lightweight architecture.

### Training Process

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Images are resized to 256x128 pixels and normalized.
2. **Data Augmentation**: Random horizontal flipping and color jittering are applied during training.
3. **Optimization**: Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and weight decay of 5e-4.
4. **Learning Rate Schedule**: Step decay, reducing the learning rate by a factor of 0.1 every 20 epochs.

### Loss Function

We employ Cross-Entropy Loss with Label Smoothing. Label smoothing helps to prevent the model from becoming overconfident and improves generalization. The loss function is defined as:

```python
class CrossEntropyLabelSmooth(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes, epsilon=0.1):
        super(CrossEntropyLabelSmooth, self).__init__()
        self.num_classes = num_classes
        self.epsilon = epsilon
        self.logsoftmax = nn.LogSoftmax(dim=1)

    def forward(self, inputs, targets):
        log_probs = self.logsoftmax(inputs)
        targets = torch.zeros_like(log_probs).scatter_(1, targets.unsqueeze(1), 1)
        targets = (1 - self.epsilon) * targets + self.epsilon / self.num_classes
        loss = (-targets * log_probs).mean(0).sum()
        return loss
```

This loss function distributes a small probability (Îµ) uniformly among all classes, which helps to reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize.

## Results

After training, our model achieved the following performance on the test set:

- **mAP (mean Average Precision)**: 0.7837
- **Rank-1 Accuracy (CMC@1)**: 0.9348
- **Rank-5 Accuracy (CMC@5)**: 0.9825
- **Rank-10 Accuracy (CMC@10)**: 0.9903

These results demonstrate strong performance, with the model correctly identifying the same person in the top-1 match 93.48% of the time, and in the top-5 matches 98.25% of the time.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of a modified ResNet18 architecture for person re-identification on the Market-1501 dataset. The use of label smoothing in the loss function and careful data preprocessing contributed to achieving competitive results while maintaining a relatively lightweight model architecture.
